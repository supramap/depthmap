<h3>Depthmap Creation</h3>
<p>
To create a kml, upload a csv with the following fields: <br/><br/>
label: Name of the location. <br/>
lat: Latitude of the location. <br/>
long: Longitude of the location. <br/>
altitude (optional): Altitude relative to sea level.  Will be at ground level if unspecified. <br/>
date (optional) in YYYY-MM-DD format: Date when the sample was collected.  Allows all locations to be viewed on a timeline.<br/>
icon/color (optional): This field specifies either an image url or a color in aabbggrr hex format.<br/>
If an image url is provided, the location's placemark will use that image.<br/>
If a color is provided, the location's placemark will be a pushpin of the specified color.<br/><br/>
An example file demonstrating the required format can be found <a href="/files/example.csv">here</a>.<br/>
NOTE: In order to view all locations with dates, the time slider in Google Earth must be expanded.<br/><br/>

If you would like to leave one of the optional fields blank, make sure you still leave a blank space for the attribute in the csv.
For example, if you wanted to leave date blank, the csv line would look like this:  Example,10.0,10.0,0,,FF00FF00
